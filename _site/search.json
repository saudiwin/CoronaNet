    "text": "Cindy Cheng\nAs a political scientist, my work has primarily engaged in examining the politics of crisis, including how both governments and people react to crisis and uncertainty as well as how their actions can contribute to it. I have explored these topics across a wide variety of issue areas common to the field of international political economy, including the COVID-19 pandemic, food safety, foreign aid and trade.\nAs a data scientist, I have deep expertise in applying a wide variety of methodological approaches ( e.g. causal inference, predictive modeling) and tools (e.g. (non)linear modeling, machine learning, Bayesian statistics) to forward new insights and research.\nWebsite: http://cindyyawencheng.com/"

    "text": "This is the permanent home for data and resources related to CoronaNet, a project to create a policy dataset for government actions in response to COVID-19. Data collection for this project has finished and current efforts are aimed at cleaning and systematizing the data. Currently there is coverage for most countries in the world and for hundreds of sub-national units, including provinces and cities, from January of 2020 through December of 2021. The most complete coverage is for the European Union and Russia thanks for a EU Horizons Initiative grant. Coverage of other countries has been increased through data integration from other COVID-19 policy projects, including the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker and COVID-AMP.\nAt present, the project is being led by PIs Cindy Cheng and Robert Kubinec."
