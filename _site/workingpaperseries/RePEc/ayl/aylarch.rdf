Name: CoronaNet Researchers Working Paper Series
Maintainer-Email: workingpapers.cn@gmail.com
Description: The CoronaNet Working Paper Series encourages CoronaNet researchers, who are mostly students volunteering their time, 
to go beyond the crucial work of gathering and coding information about COVID-19-related policies and hone their research and writing 
skills by conducting their own analyses inspired by the CoronaNet data. The working papers are the capstone of a program which offers 
research assistants the opportunity to explore research topics of genuine interest to them, acquire and practice the requisite skills 
to analyze the CoronaNet data, learn more about the dataset to which they have contributed, practice their academic writing skills, and 
collaborate with their peers in research and writing. To this end, the program entails seminars on research methods and academic writing, 
detailed introductions on the publicly released CoronaNet data structure, and tutorials on conducting quantitative analyses of the data. 
In addition, CoronaNet principal investigators provide oversight and feedback on paper drafts while Working Paper Series coordinators 
organize the program series. The papers in this series are thus not peer-reviewed but provide an opportunity to learn about preliminary 
findings that arise out of the CoronaNet database.
