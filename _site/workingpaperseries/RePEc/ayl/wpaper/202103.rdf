Title: Mask Independency: Taiwan's response to mask shortage in the COVID-19 pandemic
Abstract: In the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, most territories worldwide suffered from face mask 
shortages, given its huge demand and limited production capacity. However, Taiwan faced such a shortage only 
briefly due to their ability to swiftly increase local production of face masks. This not only allowed them to 
guarantee local supply for all their citizens but also to export them for profit at a later stage. In this paper, 
we argue that several reasons led to the success of Taiwan's mask independence. First, its previous experience with 
the 2003 SARS epidemic that subsequently led to institutional and legal changes, an increased awareness in the population 
about PPE and hygiene, and experienced technocrats. Also, the developmental state model offers the basis for a quick change 
of the national market and an increased cooperation between the private sector and the government.
