<p>This project has always had to deal with uncertainty given that we are collecting data in real time and we thus cannot know ahead of time how long the pandemic will last and how governments will react to it. Having project-wide goals helps us coordinate and make sure that despite the uncertainty, we are doing our best to collect data for all over the world for the same time periods and ensure high quality in our data collection efforts. Having complete and clean data for many countries over the same time period is crucial to say anything about what the drivers and effects of COVID-19 government policies are.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.coronanet-project.org/coronanet_goals" target="_blank">overall CoronaNet Project Goals</a></strong> are to ensure complete and clean data for all countries.</p>
<p>In order to assess progress toward the CoronaNet Project Goals. It is necessary to conduct <strong><a href="https://www.coronanet-project.org/data_assessment" target="_blank">data assessments</a></strong> on a regular basis. These assessments are done using the version of the data in the Shiny App along the following criteria:</p>

<p>Data collection and entry forms the foundation on which the rest of the project is built. The ultimate goal of the project is to produce an accurate and complete record of all policies governments have taken in response to COVID-19. This entails 1) identifying relevant policies that governments have taken in response to COVID-19 2) documenting them in a standardized format.</p>

<li>Look through the RA FAQs in the <strong><a href="https://kubinec.shinyapps.io/corona_validate/" target="_blank">Shiny App</a></strong> for commonly asked questions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The value of this data is only as good as its quality so please be sure to take your time with documenting these policies, and pose your questions to the Slack Channel or the PIs if in doubt!</p>

<div id="how-do-i-actually-do-data-collection-and-entry" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">How do I actually do data collection and entry?</h3>
<div class="tips">
<p><strong>Assess, Plan, Code, Clean!</strong></p>
<p>Doing data collection and entry requires having knowledge about 1) what the policies are in the region that you are responsible for and 2) how to document those policies in our survey instrument. To get a handle on both of these issues, it helps to first <strong>assess</strong> what the policies are in the region you are coding, make a <strong>plan</strong> for how to code them in the survey, <strong>code</strong> the policies into the survey and <strong>clean</strong> any previous entries or inconsistencies in the data. In the below, we provide more guidance on what this all means:</p>
<p><strong>Assess</strong></p>
<p>In order to assess the current state of the data and to learn more about their country before they start coding, RAs are asked to create a country overview template. This enables everyone to get a good understanding of the policies that have already been entered in their country/region, so that there is no duplication of policies, to see what policies might need to be ended or updated and also what policies have not been entered at all. This should be finished and sent to the Regional Manager within 7-10 days.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tum-conf.zoom.us/rec/share/qnbb_bzGMllKWYqEb6IqE_498K_V902RYPE5bo78v11S8Wp-3dmR5l-zT2JQHA-O.zHDV3DOhsmw0dxgv" target="_blank">Video</a></strong> how to fill out country overview template (Password f5G6^AY7).</li>

<li>How to use the Shinyapp <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUKIw3ntleI&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video.</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plan</strong></p>
<p>Next RAs are asked to create a plan for how they want to enter their first policies. This helps see how policies are connected to each other with updates and gives the Regional Manager a chance to offer some feedback and tips on how to better code policies.

<p><strong>Code</strong></p>
<p>The process of coding policies is different for every country and region, some countries have relatively straight forward policies and others have fine grained and confusing policies. When in doubt on how to code a policy, we recommend that RAs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask their question in the ra-chat, regional/country channel, or ask their regional or country manager.</li>
<li>Check out the <strong><a href="https://www.coronanet-project.org/coding_guide.html" target="_blank">coding guide.</a></strong></li>
<li>For more general support check out our Zoom <strong><a href="https://tum-conf.zoom.us/j/92401524948" target="_blank">hangout room</a></strong> where RAs can code together or have a chat (Password 12345).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clean</strong></p>
<p>In order to achieve the project goal of having clean and complete policies we are focusing on the policy end dates. We have currently a weekly <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFh6EyIRjYA" target="_blank">missing end dates competition in this video here</a></strong> to encourage RAs to bring these up to date as soon as possible. Learn more about the missing end dates competition in this video here and find out which policies are missing end dates for your country/region <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L724VBmksAB6_Hdvdlvpf1YNx4m8qP6V" target="_blank">here.</a></strong></p>
<p>You can use the <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jsSnJQpNYBBuXuIc4DtA1l5JmSY96lGnJ69HevgVphs/edit#gid=715784090" target="_blank">automated data quality checklist</a></strong> to double check whether some of the data for your country needs to be updated. Remember to be in touch with your regional or country manager to do a full assessment and make a plan as to how to best bring the data up to date.</p>

<div id="what-counts-as-a-policy" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">What counts as a ‘policy’?</h3>
<p>These policies can be thought as being in one of two categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A new policy</li>
<li>An updated policy</li>
</ol>
<p>A <strong>new policy</strong> is a policy in a category that the government has not addressed before, such as the imposition of a quarantine on the country. An <strong>updated</strong> policy is a policy change in which the details of the policy change, <strong>but not whom the policy is targeted at</strong>. For example, if Germany announces a quarantine for one province, and then later extends the quarantine for two weeks, that would count as an <strong>update</strong>. But if Germany announces a quarantine covering the whole country, that would count as a <strong>new policy</strong>. The same logic goes for travel bans – making travel bans cover more countries/areas counts as new policies. Changing the way existing travel bans are enforced would be an <strong>update</strong>. For more information, please reference the codebook below. Please watch the required training on zoom on how to do updates to the data for more information and refer to the accompanying slides.</p>
<center>
<strong>If in doubt, ask on the #ra-chat Slack channel!</strong>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the Qualtrics survey, you must select either new or updated. To update a policy, find the previous record either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Record Look up sheet or</li>
<li>The Shiny Web Application</li>
</ol>
<p>Moving forward, we would want you to use the web application as it contains the same data as the Record Lookup sheet, but in a format that is easier to visualize. Also, you can do some corrections in the app itself.</p>
<p>To update, click on the ‘update’ link that is on the left-hand side of the table/google sheet. See pictures:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For each country, check the data sources, in the order given below in the “Data Sources” section, for relevant information on government policy toward combating the coronavirus.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the relevant information into your country specific dataset. It should always be possible to answer the following request/questions for a particular policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of entry is this? (e.g. new, correction, update)</li>
<li>Description of the government policy.</li>
<li>What is the policy category? (e.g. travel ban)</li>
<li>From what level of government does this policy originate from?</li>
<li>What kind of enforcement does this policy have (if any)?</li>
<li>Which organizations or entities are in charge of enforcing a policy?</li>
<li>When was the policy announced?</li>
<li>What information sources did you use to identify this policy?</li>
</ul>
<p><br> Some, but not all policies,[^1] will also require you to identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which geographical entity is the target of this policy?</li>
<li>What or whom is the policy targeted toward?</li>
<li>Is this policy inbound, outbound or both?</li>
<li>What kind of transportation is this policy targeted toward?</li>
</ul>
<p>When it is not possible to collect this information, please note the reason for the difficulty at the end of the survey.</p>
<p>Please document each source by answering the according survey question. Currently, the dataset allows you to code up to 10 sources. Note also that it is possible that you will need more than one source to collect all the information for each event.</p></li>
<li><p>Save a .pdf for each data source that you use. As the file name, use the following format: [Date Collected]_[Title of article].pdf where the [Date Collected] should follow the format MM-DD-YYYY.</p></li>
<li><p>You can upload the file within the Qualtrics survey (be sure to choose the correct country).</p></li>

<!-- ## Data Cleaning{-} -->
<!-- ** ** -->
<!-- ### Why are we doing data cleaning?{-} -->
<!-- In parallel to the regular validation process, we need reliable people who can take the responsibility of cleaning our main dataset. As of today, we have over 180,000 policies in the dataset with great granularity. Unsurprisingly, we are sure that some of them have errors and typos. While it will be impossible to correct all of them, we need to make an effort to minimize errors. To do this, we have designed the following cleaning protocol that those involved with data cleaning should follow. -->
<!-- ### What should be ‘cleaned’?{-} -->
<!-- The goal of data cleaning is to clean _clear errors and or typos_ as opposed to conceptual errors. -->
<!-- Clear errors/typos are of the following kind: e.g. the policy is targeted toward ' China, Iran, Singapore, South Korea, or Italy’ but the original coder left out ‘Iran’. -->
<!-- Conceptual errors have more to do with how certain policy types should be coded to match our coding guidance: e.g. is this policy about social distancing or a quarantine? -->
<!-- There will be a gray zone between clear errors and conceptual errors. Please do feel very very free to ask us as many questions as you have about what should be ‘cleaned’ and what shouldn’t be and how to clean it, but for the most part, if you’re finding it difficult to judge if something is an ‘error’ or not,  then leave it alone. -->
<!-- Please pay special attention to the qualitative description, as it should contain: -->
<!-- *   <span style="color:white; background-color: #E74C3C;">The name of the country from which a policy originates.</span> -->
<!-- *   <span style="color:white; background-color: #3498DB;">The date the policy is supposed to take effect.</span> -->
<!-- *   <span style="color:white; background-color: #944DB1;">Information about the 'type' of policy (see buttons below).</span> -->
<!-- *   <span style="color:#3CB56F;">If applicable, the country or region that a policy is targeted towards.</span> -->
<!-- *   <span style="color:#D35401;">If applicable, the type of people or resources a policy is targeted towards.</span> -->
<!-- *   If applicable, when a policy is slated to end -->
<!-- A proper description should contain all the above points where applicable. -->
<!-- ### How do I get started with data cleaning?{-} -->
<!-- The process requires you to follow these basic instructions: -->
<!-- #### Assign yourself a Cleaning Task{-} -->
<!-- 1. Assign yourself to record_ids under cleaned_ra for a country you’d like to clean in the corona_clean [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nG1gAYwDMNfcSk345Q5ZfAhH9pG5lGSt5vD_lGMdN9Y/edit#gid=505667220){target="_blank"}: -->
<!-- 2. Make sure one of the PIs invites you to the #data_cleaning_ Slack channel.  -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](images/manual_img/2. data cleaning slack.png){width=30%} -->
<!-- </center> -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- #### Download the Data{-} -->
<!-- * If you are using R, you can go to the CoronaNet website and [download the latest version](https://www.coronanet-project.org/download.html?){target="_blank"} of our core dataset (CoronaNet Database BETA Version 1.0 (core)). -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](images/manual_img/data_download.png){width=80%} -->
<!-- </center> -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- * If you are using Excel, you can go to the Google Drive folder with all the .csv files for the countries which will be updated regularly. You can download your country data from either: [This link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/19cRR9cUJiNZK1naEcL8V78GYVvkoIQSN){target="_blank"} or Or from the link in the #general Slack channel or from the Dashboards. -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](images/manual_img/data_clean.png){width=80%} -->
<!-- </center> -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- #### Clean the Data{-} -->
<!-- 1. In the main dataset, for the observations that you have been assigned to, evaluate whether the information entered across all columns adequately captures the information in the column "event_description." -->
<!-- 2. To check the event description:  -->
<!--     *   Using R, please use the R-Studio code posted in the #data_cleaning_ Slack Channel. For instructions on how to use the code, please watch this [video.](https://corona-govt-response.slack.com/archives/G011RS4L03Y/p1591792230012400){target="_blank"} -->
<!--     *   Using Excel, please use this [Excel guideline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qL-R2jBB7P-Y6jc2mC_2AL57jj8mT_dWpMR_dDrEZ2s/edit){target="_blank"}. For visual guidelines on how to get your data organized, you can watch this [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYjLrFjdaYE&feature=youtu.be){target="_blank"} -->
<!-- 3. If you consider that the observation requires no changes, move to the next observation. -->
<!-- 4. If you think that the observation requires being changed, correct the entry using either:  -->
<!--     *   The RShiny App: (Note that the released dataset has one row per target rather than one row per entry, so you need to take that into account when adding a correction). The instructions on how to use the R-Shiny app are also present on the video above.  -->
<!--     *   Qualtrics: Enter Shiny apps and find the entry you want to correct. On the left side of the entry you can click on “Correct” and it will open a link that will direct you to the Qualtrics survey. -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- 5. **NOTE: You should not be spending more than a couple of minutes per record maximum, if you’re spending more time, than either ask for guidance in the #data_cleaning_ channel or move on.**    -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- #### Dealing with Systematic errors{-} -->
<!-- 6. If, in the process of cleaning, you notice that the original coder is making a systematic error, please: -->
<!--     *   Notify the #data_cleaning channel that this is has happened. -->
<!--     *   After consulting with a PI, please contact the original coder and let them know that they are making this systematic error and ask them if they could please code back, and make the appropriate corrections to their entries. -->
<!--     *   If the original coder is no longer involved in the project or otherwise unresponsive, please let the #data_cleaning_ channel know and we will assign a new RA to address this systematic error. -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- #### Finalize a Cleaning Task{-} -->
<!-- 7. Once you have finalized cleaning all the observations that you have been assigned to, please update the “due date” in Trello and move the card to the column on the right to “complete” section. -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- ### How do I become a data cleaner?{-} -->
<!-- Data cleaners must possess a deep knowledge of the ins and outs of the survey and data collection process to maintain the integrity of the data cleaning process. Data cleaners must also possess working knowledge of a programming language (preferably R) in order to participate in the data cleaning process. To date, a select few research assistants have been invited to be data cleaners only after they have spent substantial time with data collection and validation. -->
<!-- ### Examples{-} -->
<!-- <div class="tips"> -->
<!-- For example, see policy_id = 6298255: -->
<!-- event_description = 'Albania began health checks at the airport for passengers coming from China, Iran, Singapore, South Korea, or Italy on February 25th'. -->
<!-- 4 rows: -->
<!-- target_country = China (row1) -->
<!-- target_country = Italy  (row2) -->
<!-- target_country = Singapore (row3) -->
<!-- target_country = South Korea (row4) -->
<!-- Our coder forgot to select "Iran" in this entry. Sort the dataset to make sure that Iran has not been added later on (e.g., order the data by "init_country" and "target_country" and search for "Albania" and "Iran"). Once you certify that Iran is missing, go to the main survey in Qualtrics and add a Correction for this record_id where you will be able to correct the target_country so that you select China, Italy, Singapore, South Korea AND Iran. All else equal. Remember to sort the data again by "record_date" so that you ONLY change the observations that have been assigned to you). -->
<!-- Example 2: -->
<!-- policy_ID  5808477 -->
<!-- Event_description: “Nation steps up to COVID-19 Alert Level 2” -->
<!-- This policy is coded under “Declaration of Emergency”, but the description is not precise enough (there is no country name, and no dates) to understand if this policy was coded correctly. In this case we need to refer to the source, check the entry according to the information in the source, then correct the description and other variables if needed. -->

<h2 class="unnumbered">Data Validation</h2>
<hr />
<div id="why-do-we-validate-data" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">Why do we validate data?</h3>
<p>Data validation is required to ensure our dataset is reliable and accurate. At the moment we have over 500 hundred hard working research assistants that are entering more than 17,000 policies, updates and corrections. With so many minds, there is bound to be a difference of opinion and skill on how policies should be coded. This difference gives rise to conceptual errors and policies that have been entered that differ to our coding guidelines. For example, is a policy about quarantining or lockdown? Should a policy be entered as one, or broken down into smaller policies? Ideally, we should have high intercoder reliability, which means that two independent people will code the same source in the same way, but with a complex survey this is increasingly difficult. To increase intercoder reliability, we have designed a validation process.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-do-we-validate-data" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">How do we validate data?</h3>
<p>Validation is split into two main stages; recoding and reconciliation. Recoding is carried out by experienced coders, from a source chosen out of the randomly selected validation dataset. Reconciliation is done by the validation PIs, who take the original policy and the recoded entries and try to find a match, determining if two independent coders, who had the same source, found the same policy and coded it in the same way.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered">Second Round of Validation: “Checking”</h3>
<p>Every entry in the validation set will be validated twice. The second round of validation - termed checking for clarity - will help us determine the most appropriate coding for each policy. The procedure for checking is _nearly _identical to the first round of validation described above. Two important things to note:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You should <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span></strong> check an observation that you coded in the original dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>You should <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span></strong> check an observation that you validated in the first round of validation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is important that each round (original entry, validation, and checking) be done by three different individuals. This ensures that our original coding, validation, and checking processes are independent of each other and makes the quality of our data more reliable (statistically speaking)! What follows is a description of how to get involved in checking the data.</p>

<div id="what-is-data-integration" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">What is Data Integration?</h4>
<p>Data integration is assessing the overlap between data external to CoronaNet and recoding data that is currently missing from CoronaNet into the CoronaNet taxonomy, while giving proper attribution to the original coders. To see the list of external datasets we are integrating data from, see the <a href="https://www.coronanet-project.org/data_integration_guidelines" target="_blank">Data Integration Guidelines</a>.There are in total around 150,000 policies that we have identified in the external data which we can potentially integrate into the CoronaNet dataset. We have done our best to map this external data to the CoronaNet taxonomy but there are some things that we cannot control and we need your help to work through.</p>
<p>The external data should be seen as an additional source of information that we hope will make it easier and faster for RAs to identify policies to document for their country or subnational region. However, like all sources of information we use, we still need to vet this information carefully before incorporating it into the CoronaNet data. While there are around 150,000 observations in the external data, that doesn’t mean we aim to increase the CoronaNet database by 150,000 observations. This is for a variety of reasons. <br></p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-integrate-data" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">How to integrate data?</h4>
<p>First of all, make sure you read the Data Integration Guidelines and you have access to the CoronaNet Data Integration Sheet:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify data that other datasets have documented but which are not currently in the CoronaNet dataset. Fill in this information in the overlap_assess column in the CoronaNet data Integration sheet.</li>
</ol>
<center>
<img src="images/manual_img/data_integration.png" style="width:80.0%" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Recode the data that is not currently in CoronaNet:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>To recode this data, RAs should adhere to the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Identify policies that are not currently in the CoronaNet dataset by searching for rows that have the value ‘No’ in the overlap_assess column</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the ‘link’ or ‘pdf_link’ for that observation and read through the information in the raw data source.</p></li>
<li><p>Code the information that you find in that link into the CoronaNet Qualtrics survey. You can use the other column information which maps in the CoronaNet Integration Sheet as a guide for how you can code certain fields.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of the CoronaNet Qualtrics Survey, you will be asked two questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>[collab] “If (one of) the sources that you used to document this policy came from another dataset, please note which dataset’ ➪ Information about the dataset that you are integrating will be found in the ‘data’ column in the CoronaNet Data; if you used a source/link that you yourself found, please choose ‘I found this source myself’ instead.</li>
<li>[collab_id] ‘Please copy and paste the unique id of the record that you used from the other dataset in the text entry below’ ➪ If you use a source from an external dataset, in this field, copy and paste the ‘unique_id’ found in the ‘unique_id’ column for this observation found in the CoronaNet Data Integration sheet.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In the ‘integrated’ column in the CoronaNet Data Integration sheet, please choose one of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>‘Integrated’; this means you have identified a policy that was in another dataset and recoded it into the CoronaNet taxonomy.</li>
<li>‘Integrated with additional original research’: You may have to do some additional research for any number of reasons. E.g. the information that you receive from the link or pdf_link of the external dataset may be unclear or require additional context/knowledge to code well. In such cases, please note what additional research you had to do in the ‘Notes’ column and click this option.</li>
<li>‘Integrated with additional work to find a new link’ means that the original link for the policy as noted in the CoronaNet Data Integration sheet is dead but that the RA was able to find a new link that corroborates the information described in the ‘description’ column. In this case please choose ‘I found this source myself’ option in 2.4 and click this option in the data integration sheet. Note that if you were able to find the information from the original link using the <a href="http://web.archive.org/" target="_blank">Way Back Machine</a> then choose the ‘Integrated or ‘Integrated with additional original research’ option as appropriate.</li>
<li>‘Integrated with additional original research AND with additional work to find a new link’: means fulfilled both the criterion under: ‘Integrated with additional original research’ and ‘Integrated with additional work to find a new link’. See above for more information.</li>
<li>‘Duplicated policy’: this means that there were multiple external policies that were duplicates of each other. In this case, please only integrate one of them (and choose one of the ‘integrated’ options above). When you click this option, this means you do not integrate this particular policy because it is a duplicate. If the data is already in CoronaNet, pick one policy to mark as ‘Yes’ in the overlap_assessment and find the corresponding record_id to paste into the matched_record_id column. In general, for duplicated data, the overlap_assessment should be ‘No’.</li>
<li>‘Not a relevant policy’: this means that after having taken a closer look at the link for the observation is not one that we would code in CoronaNet. The corresponding overlap_assessment should be ‘No’ in this case.</li>
<li>‘Link dead, no other link found’ means that the original link for the policy as noted in the CoronaNet Data Integration sheet is dead and the RA was unable to i) use the <a href="http://web.archive.org/" target="_blank">Way Back Machine</a> to find the original data ii) find another link to corroborate this information. In this case, please do not recode this data.</li>

<h2 class="unnumbered">Data Science Team</h2>
<hr />
<p>The data science team exists to manage the export and cleaning of Qualtrics survey data, and also to visualize and analyze the data. This team is led by Tim Model (Chief Data Scientist) and Cindy Cheng. The members of this team may have some data entry responsibilities but their primary goal is to ensure that our data pipeline is as smooth as possible, and also to employ data-analytic tools to check the data and extract insights.</p>
<p>Regular tasks assigned to the team include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Daily exports of the Qualtrics data to our Github site, including cleaning the data, uploading for the RA record sheet/RShiny Data Validation App.</li>
<li>Retrieving changed records from the RShiny Data Validation App and merging into the released data.</li>
<li>Maintenance of the RShiny Data Validation App.</li>
<li>Help with adjusting the Qualtrics JavaScript backend.</li>
<li>Extract insights from the data through analysis and visualization.</li>
<li>Monitoring the #orphaned-records channel and adding deleted records to removal lists (and also identify any record issues outstanding).</li>
</ol>
<p>The data science team currently consists of five groups:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Qualtrics: developing, managing, and maintaining the Qualtrics survey.</li>
<li>Data Pipeline: data cleaning and wrangling, as well as releasing data to record lookup, AWS, and public Github repository.</li>
<li>Shiny App: developing, managing, and maintaining the Shiny app used for data validation by RAs.</li>
<li>Issue Triage and QC: identifying source of errors reported in Slack and elsewhere, including bad record IDs .</li>
<li>Data Visualization: developing visualizations for public-facing presentations of our data.</li>

<div id="qualtrics" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered">Qualtrics</h2>
<hr />
<p>Once an RA is onboarded, they will receive a link to the Qualtrics survey they should use to enter new records.</p>
<p>RA’s should select their name from the drop-down list (Hint: typing your name once the drop-down list is open makes it easier to find yourself in the list).</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvNMpwj0onFvUZ_gLl4RRjqS-clbHv3TIX6EOHofsME/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">CoronaNet Data Codebook</a></strong> can be used to help fill out the Qualtrics survey.</p>
<p>The penultimate page of the Qualtrics survey is a review of all the information about the policy that has been entered, RA’s should scroll down and read this page before finally clicking on the ‘advance arrow’ to ensure the entry gets submitted to the dataset.</p>
<p><strong>How to retrieve a PDF Source?</strong></p>
<p>If you are working on validating an entry, you can request a PDF source by posting in the #ra-validation channel and someone with access to the survey will retrieve it for you. You can also use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1khoRcd-P6vE9MjY3BO7YH-ZvGlPXsEqRIlueqZYMw_E/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">this list</a>, which will take you to your countries PDF source list.</p>
<p>Note that only those with permission to view/edit the Qualtrics survey will be able to retrieve a PDF Source. You will only be granted access if you are actively working on editing the Qualtrics survey or actively working on the raw Qualtrics output. Validators should not request to view the raw survey, as this will compromise the blind validation process.</p>
<p>If you do have permission to view/edit the survey, you can retrieve a source by following this procedure:</p>
<p>Click on the dataset &gt; Data &amp; Analysis &gt; Add Filter &gt; Embedded data, record ID &gt; Once you have the record you want, click Export &amp; Import &gt; Export &gt; User Submitted Files. This will produce a .zip file of the desired source pdf(s) for that record ID.</p>

If you still do not receive one a few days after joining the project, please message in the #record-tracker-app channel on Slack.</p>
<p><strong>What do I use the app for?</strong></p>
<p>You can use it to: <br> * Make corrections to policy entries (NOT updates) * Find links to make corrections or updates to a policy entry * Look at what policies have currently been entered for certain countries * See a timeline visualization of policies * Find FAQs for internal use about the project</p>
<p><strong>How often is the data updated in the app?</strong></p>
<p>The data is updated approximately every 24 hours. In the “Recorded Data” section of the app, it will note the most recent data currently in the app.</p>

<!-- ### Cornedit{-} -->
<!-- Cornedit allows you to edit and clean the data in a more simple way than Qualtrics. Meanwhile though  Shiny is great for visualizing the data, the actual editing is simpler using Cornedit. Through it, all RAs have the ability to edit basic but very important parts of the dataset. Given the wide spectrum of changes that this tool provides it is very important that before using it, you have watched the training video on how to use Cornedit, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsmJ7uY8_-Y){target="_blank"}. If you have any questions please reach out to your Regional or Country Manager. -->
<!-- To use Cornedit you need to register through the link you were sent. If you have not received it, please contact Project Management so they can arrange your access. Once you register and log in, you will be able to see the following screen: -->

<!-- <div class="tips-header">&#128161; **Note**</div> -->
<!-- Sometimes it will display a gray screen with the text “disconnected from the server”. If this happens, simply reload the page and that should get it to work. It sometimes takes a couple of tries. If this still does not work, contact the project management team. -->
<!-- </div> -->
<!-- Once you see the screen you can select the country and policy type you wish to check and/or correct by selecting them in the filters. After you select what you wish, the corresponding entries will be displayed in the list below the filters: -->

<!-- ![](images/manual_img/cornedit_02.png){width=80%} -->
<!-- </center> -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- You can scroll through the list and once you find the entry you want to modify, you select it by clicking on it and then click on the “Edit” button at the top of the list, beneath the country filter. After selecting the entry for editing, this window will pop up which will allow you to modify various aspects of the entry: -->

<!-- <br> -->
<!-- When you are satisfied with the changes save them and they are not yet saved to the database. You can review your edits in the ‘View Edits’ tab and when you’re satisfied, click the blue ‘Upload to database’ button on the left hand side of the app  in order for your changes to go through. You can then click the ‘Download Updated Date’ button if you want to see if your changes when through.  -->
<!-- If, after reviewing your edits on the ‘View Edits’ tab you are unsatisfied with them and you have not yet clicked ‘Upload to database’, you can click the ‘Reset’ button on the left  hand side of the app and the changes you made will revert.  -->
<!-- Through Cornedit it is also possible to delete policies. You can do this by selecting the policy you want to delete and then clicking on the ‘delete’ button at the top of the list. A pop up window will appear where you can again click on ‘delete’. This will delete the record for the session you are on. You can double check which policies you have deleted by clicking on the ‘View Deleted (Current Session)’ tab at the top of the page. Be careful when deleting policies but in case you make a mistake, don’t freak out. There is still a failsafe that allows us to restore deleted policies. But for that you need to go to the ‘View Deleted (Current Session)’ tab and take note of the policy_id of the entry you want to recover. It is also possible to go back and check older deleted records in the ‘View All Deleted” tab so that in a worst case scenario, it is still possible to go back and check. -->
<!-- Please take into account that this is a very powerful tool and gives you the possibility of making important changes to the database. Before using Cornedit, make sure you have watched the [video on how to use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsmJ7uY8_-Y){target="_blank"} and remember, with great power comes great responsibility! -->

<h3 class="unnumbered">Onboarding new RAs</h3>
<p><strong>Assess, Plan, Code, Clean!</strong></p>
<p>Doing data collection and entry requires having knowledge about 1) what the policies are in the region that you are responsible for and 2) how to document those policies in our survey instrument. To get a handle on both of these issues, it helps to first <strong>assess</strong> what the policies are in the region you are coding, make a <strong>plan</strong> for how to code them in the survey, <strong>code</strong> the policies into the survey and <strong>clean</strong> any previous entries or inconsistencies in the data. In the below, we provide more guidance on what this all means:</p>
<p><strong>Assess</strong></p>
<p>In order to assess the current state of the data and to learn more about their country before they start coding, RAs are asked to create a country overview template. This enables everyone to get a good understanding of the policies that have already been entered in their country/region, so that there is no duplication of policies, to see what policies might need to be ended or updated and also what policies have not been entered at all. This should be finished and sent to the Regional Manager within 7-10 days.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://tum-conf.zoom.us/rec/share/qnbb_bzGMllKWYqEb6IqE_498K_V902RYPE5bo78v11S8Wp-3dmR5l-zT2JQHA-O.zHDV3DOhsmw0dxgv" target="_blank">Video</a></strong> how to fill out country overview template (Password f5G6^AY7).</li>

<li>How to use the Shinyapp <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUKIw3ntleI&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video.</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plan</strong></p>
<p>Next RAs are asked to create a plan for how they want to enter their first policies. This helps see how policies are connected to each other with updates and gives the Regional Manager a chance to offer some feedback and tips on how to better code policies. Once the plan is submitted to the regional manager, they will set up a zoom or skype meeting for some one-on-one feedback.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Code</strong></p>
<p>The process of coding policies is different for every country and region, some countries have relatively straight forward policies and others have fine grained and confusing policies. When in doubt on how to code a policy, we recommend that RAs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask their question in the ra-chat, regional/country channel, or ask their regional or country manager.</li>
<li>Check out the <strong><a href="https://www.coronanet-project.org/coding_guide.html" target="_blank">coding guide.</a></strong></li>
<li>For more general support check out our Zoom <strong><a href="https://tum-conf.zoom.us/j/92401524948" target="_blank">hangout room</a></strong> where RAs can code together or have a chat (Password 12345).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clean</strong></p>
<p>In order to achieve the project goal of having clean and complete policies up until October 1, 2020 by our deadline of January 1, 2021 we are focusing on cleaning different policy types each week. RAs are to fill out their regional/country checklist once a week. This checklist breaks the cleaning process into small tasks for each policy type.</p>

<li><p>Once a month please fill out the <a href="https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9ow8HYFk3lg4l38" target="_blank">RM/CM Monthly Survey</a> where we ask you some basic questions about what goals you’ve set for your country or subnational region and how RA activity has been like <em>for each country or subnational region</em>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Each manager should feel free to fill out this survey separately for just the jurisdictions they are responsible for. If this is the case for you, just choose the number of countries/subnational regions that you are responsible for in the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>It may be the case that because there is no RA currently active in a given country or subnational region, it makes no sense to report goals. There is an option in the survey for this situation.</li>
<li>Finally, in the next survey we will send around next month, we will ask you about your progress towards your goals. At that time, you will also be given the option to adjust your goals depending on how it went over the last month.</li>
<li>Additionally, please contact the project management team to provide any additional information that you think is important to report. This can include:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Whether there are any inactive RAs in your group.</li>
<li>Whether there are any country reports or research notes you would like to be posted to the website.<br></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Check for up-to-dateness. This involves providing information about when an RA was last able to code policies for their country/region.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>By ‘up to date’ we mean, just knowing about when the last time it was that an RA was able to look at a particular country in a given week. It is fine if they didn’t have time, just having the information is in itself valuable</li>
<li>Please have the RAs under your responsibility fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gNvxWSrAdrM2aj7JyQKlAdQNdBkl7kDMOdJWSZBjvj0/edit?pli=1#gid=0" target="_blank">excel sheet</a>: noting when they were able to document policies for a particular country.

<li>If the work is not up to date, please make sure that you know the reason why.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>If the RA does not have time for a given week but is otherwise stated a commitment to the project, then note this in the excel sheet by filling in “On a break” in the “Are the RA’s Active?” column.</li>
<li>If the RA is unresponsive/no longer active, these tasks may need to be reallocated. You may also nudge and message or nudge RA in your region to be more responsive. <br></li>

</ol></li>
<li>Each policy type is appropriately coded over time:
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For example, it may be the case that there are multiple policies about ‘restrictions on mass gatherings’ that overlap over time. This may be because a) the government has implemented sequential updates to one policy about restriction of mass gatherings such that the policies should not in fact, overlap in time and corrections need to be done to fix the timeline of a given policy or b) the government has implemented multiple policies for restrictions of mass gatherings that should indeed be coded separately and there is no adjustment that needs to be made. Part of your job as regional manager would be to assess if the issue is a) or b) and communicate with the RA as necessary.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>The RShiny App is primarily useful for comparing policy types and countries to pin down which policy types in which countries appear to be out of date. You can also use it to see if policies are no longer enforced (end date has passed) but may still be in force, and which policies are in force but may have expired.</li>
<li>Document the completeness of the records for each week in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gNvxWSrAdrM2aj7JyQKlAdQNdBkl7kDMOdJWSZBjvj0/edit?pli=1#gid=0" target="_blank">excel sheet</a> in the ‘ ‘Policy Completeness Form’. Note we expect that checking for ‘completeness’ will be a medium-term task, such that in the beginning, it might take one week to check the completeness of a just a few policies such that it might take 4-6 weeks to do an initial assessment of the completeness of the policies for the regions under the regional/country managers’ purview. After this initial assessment is done, going forward, assessing completeness should take less time/be comparable to the time it takes to check for up-to-dateness. This is a ‘joint’ task in that both RAs and regional/country managers can fill in this spreadsheet, but regional/country managers are responsible for verifying the RAs ‘completeness’ assessment.</li>
<li>If the work is incomplete, contains errors or requires attention, please contact the RA directly to resolve any issues. If the RA is no longer active, these tasks may need to be reallocated. Regional managers may also message or nudge an RA in their region to be more responsive.</li>
<li>If you find repeated errors with the coding in your region, leave a note in the “RA Activity+Notes” tab.<br></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Delegate tasks within their region. If a new RA is allocated to their region, they can delegate states or tasks to them as needed.<br></p></li>
<li><p>Check and give approval for country reports for their region.<br></p></li>
<li><p>Weekly meetings with their team. Each Regional and Country manager should organize a short weekly Zoom meeting with your team (suggested length of time is half an hour but regional/country managers have flexibility to decide how long they want their meetings to be). Ideally regional and country managers would not go over the updates and completeness line by line in the meeting for each team member. Rather the meeting should be focused on discussing and resolving any issues in terms of the updateness or completeness of regions under your responsibility.<br></p></li>

<h2 class="unnumbered">RA Responsibilities</h2>
<p>After an RA has completed their preliminary training (i.e. they have passed the training survey and have been welcomed onto the project), each RA will initially be assigned a cleaning task to familiarize themselves with the data.</p>
<p>Once the initial cleaning task has been completed, each RA will be assigned a task to work on. They will either continue to deepen their knowledge of the cleaning process or move onto learning about data integration.They will be added to the relevant Task Force channels and should introduce themselves to their fellow RA’s in the task Force</p>
<p>They can use these channels to ask any questions they have about getting started and to communicate with the Task Force Manager. Other resources available are.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[#ra-chat]</strong>(<a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T010PHG8J6A/C010V8MKHK2" class="uri">https://app.slack.com/client/T010PHG8J6A/C010V8MKHK2</a>){target="_blank"} Slack channel</li>

<li><strong>[CoronaNet Printed Survey]</strong>(<a href="http://coronanet-project.org/survey" class="uri">http://coronanet-project.org/survey</a>){target="_blank"}</li>
<li>More relevant links are found in the ‘Useful Links’ section of the Manual</li>
</ul>
<p>Once an RA has been assigned a particular cleaning or integration task, they commit to completing and updating the records for that assignment. The RA must also enter information into the task-specific spreadsheets that will be made available to them by the Task Force Manger Manager. This information concerns the date in which they have coded policies up to and the completeness of the records – important information for the Task Force managers and should be updated regularly.</p>
<p>Please focus on coding policies at the national level. Once those policies are up to date and complete, then RAs may focus on gathering subnational data in consultation with your task force manager. Note that in this case — that is, national policies are mostly up to date/complete and you would like to start focusing on gathering subnational data — please, in consultation with your task force manager, choose a couple of states/provinces that you would like to focus on first rather than trying to code them all at once. In order to decide which states/provinces to focus on, it may help to first do a little bit of leg work to get an overall sense of how actively certain provinces/states are, and then choose provinces/states based on 1) how active they are 2) how important they are to the country (e.g. by GDP or population). If you would like to make the case for coding all subnational policies for your country, please let your task force manager know. We will then assess the situation and decide if we should assign more RAs and a task force manager for that particular country to capture sub-national policies systematically.</p>
<p>There is no requirement on the number of policies coded per day/week by each RA. Each policy is unique in their approach and we understand that finding and coding policies vary in the time it takes. It is recommended you take your time with your research before coding a policy, to ensure you code as accurately as possible. RA’s should not hesitate in asking questions in the slack channels if they are unsure. If an RA feels overwhelmed and feels they need extra support, they should contact their Task Force Managers to let them know.</p>
<p>RA’s should also participate in the weekly meeting with their Task Force Managers – which will be set up by the Task Force Managers and links posted in the Slack channel.</p>
<p>In addition, RA’s should participate in/watch the recording of the general RA meeting where updates about the whole project are shared. These meetings take place on Wednesdays at 4.30pm CET at this <a href="https://nyu.zoom.us/j/58230804">link</a>.</p>
<div id="summary-of-main-tasks" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">Summary of Main Tasks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Research policies thoroughly and enter them using the Qualtrics questionnaire.</li>
<li>Based on the number of hours you are asked to commit to the project, we expect RAs to do 25 overlap assessments or 5 coded policies each week.</li>

<!-- In this section, we explain how CoronaNeta’s project management team onboards RAs: -->
<!-- **STEP 0: **Set up the mail account: We are using Amazon AWS which you can access [here](https://coronanet.awsapps.com/mail ). Login/Password: Ask the project management team -->
<!-- Here you will find some folders in the inbox but you just need to care about the folder “RA Registration” (see screenshot). A PI or one of you should put every email from our application form in the RA-Registration Folder - Pending subfolder. All application email will have “Re: Application for Research Assistant Position” in the heading: -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](images/manual_img/project_admi_07.png){width=60%} -->

<!-- <span style="text-decoration:underline; background-color: yellow;">MAIL 1: </span> -->
<!-- |       Dear XYZ, -->
<!-- | -->
<!-- |       We appreciate your interest to join the CoronaNet Research Group. In these exceptional times it is important to gather data for real-time research. In order to apply and to become a member of the team, please fill out the following form: [https://form.jotform.com/201172569499062](https://form.jotform.com/201172569499062) -->

<!-- | -->
<!-- <span style="color:white; background-color: green;">**STEP 2: **</span>Once we get an application in the email inbox, you are going to screen the applications and evaluate them. Please note that the CVs/resumes will only go to the [admin@coronannet-project.org](mailto:admin@coronannet-project.org) email, so be sure to look for the applications there so you can read all the info. -->
<!-- With this in mind, we want at least two of you to read every application and score them on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest score possible. We have a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F2IkLcIgsw7JPzJ3sS-DcM5owF-gaoc-35T0pf6vh4U/edit#gid=0) where you can see a record of all the applications: -->
<!-- On the far right-hand side are two columns, Evaluation 1 and Evaluation 2. You can record your score there once you read it (whoever gets to it first can give a score): -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](images/manual_img/project_admi_09.png){width=80%} -->
<!-- </center> -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- We will then come back and look at the application scores and make a final decision. Once we put a Y in the decision column, you can then send them the following mail: -->
<!-- <span style="text-decoration:underline; background-color: yellow;">MAIL 2: </span> -->
<!-- Dear XYZ, -->
<!-- We are happy to announce that you have been chosen to become part of the CoronaNet Research Project. We are so excited to offer you this opportunity and we cannot wait to start working with you! There are just a few more steps to complete before you can get started.  -->
<!-- You will be involved in the data collection process. The work mainly involves sifting through news reports to identify different policies that the government has enacted to combat COVID-19. You will each be assigned one unique country if you choose to participate.  If chosen, you will be responsible for (1) researching what government policies your country has implemented starting from the beginning of the epidemic and (2) keeping up to date with new government policy actions on a daily basis. -->
<!-- First, we’d like to share a little bit about what to expect from the project. You will be assigned to a unique country and your responsibilities will include gathering historical data on COVID-19 government policy actions for your country, integrating similar data from external datasets, and cleaning existing policies. You will have the opportunity to connect with other RAs working on the same country as well as other people working on the project. Once you have become more experienced, you will have the opportunity to take on more responsibilities within the project and the opportunity to join other fun teams, such as the Data Science Team or the Social Media Team.  -->
<!-- So, let’s get started!  -->
<!-- **Listed below are the next steps to complete:** -->
<!-- 1. Training Videos - You are required to watch the following two training videos: -->
<!--       a. The Onboarding Video - This video will provide an overview of the project, explain the goals and motivation behind the project and it will give  you the tools needed to get started on Data Integration and Data Collection.] -->
<!--       b. Updating Policies - This video will provide insight on how to update policies once they have been coded. This is an important step in data collection, data cleaning and data integration.  -->
<!--       c. Data Integration - This video provides an overview on how to integrate data from external datasets and why we’re doing it.<br> -->
<!-- 2. Interactive Training - Once you’ve watched the above training videos you will be asked to complete the following survey. It is important to note that you must pass the training survey with at least 70% to join the project.  -->
<!--       a. Click here to get started and to pass that survey! <br> -->
<!-- 3. Wow! You’ve made it to step three, this is huge! Once you’ve completed the interactive training, a commitment form will automatically appear. In this form you can give us a little more information about yourself, so that we can assign you a country that fits your abilities the best! After this step, on the following Monday,  we will assign you a country and add you to Slack (our main form of communication). Wahoo! -->
<!-- We do ask that you please complete this training within 14 days of receiving this email. If you are unable to complete the training within this time frame, please send an email to admin@coronanet-project.org. -->
<!-- Some other links to know are our Code of Conduct and our CoronaNet Research Manual. We expect you to follow Code of Conduct during your entire time working on the project. Please also read the CoronaNet Research Manual and feel free to contact this email with any questions, admin@coronanet-project.org.  -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- <li>Click here for the Code of Conduct!</li> -->
<!-- <li>Click here for the CoronaNet Research Manual!</li>  -->
<!-- We know this has been so much information at once but we are so excited that you decided to join us on the CoronaNet journey. The two final things are that: -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- <li>Every Wednesday there is a general onboarding meeting at 2.30 pm CET. We look forward to seeing you here: Meeting-ID: 659 6652 3057 Password: CoronaNet.</li> -->
<!-- <li>Later in the week there is a coding onboarding meeting (TBA).</li> -->
<!-- We hope that our project will increase the public's awareness and understanding of what policies governments around the world are taking in response to the virus. Thank you for joining this journey! -->
<!-- All the best, -->
<!-- Robert Kubinek, Cindy Cheng, Joan Barcelo, and Luca Messerschmidt -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- **If we put a N in the decision column, you can send them the following email:** -->
<!-- <span style="text-decoration:underline; background-color: yellow;">MAIL 3: </span> -->
<!-- |       Dear XYZ, -->
<!-- | -->
<!-- |       We appreciate your interest and application at CoronaNet. We are sorry to tell you that we have decided not to invite you to become a research assistant for our team. This does not mean that you won't be able to use the data (which you can download here:[www.coronanet-project.org](http://www.coronanet-project.org)) or tell others about it (Twitter: coronanet_org). -->
<!-- | -->
<!-- |       We want you to know that your attempt to help us in this project is overwhelming and you are a real hero of this crisis. -->
<!-- | -->
<!-- |       All the best -->
<!-- | -->
<!-- |       CoronaNet -->

<!-- <span style="color:white; background-color: green;">**STEP 3: **</span>Once people pass the test, they are directed to a [form](https://form.jotform.com/201202703393039) they will need to fill out in order to agree with the conditions of becoming a RA. Luca is going to allocate the participant to a country and connect this person with previous RAs. It can happen that people pass the test but close the tab etc.which will not allow them to enter the form. If people send you a mail with this inquiry, leave it for Luca to check the records and make a decision. -->
<!-- Every time someone fills out the confirmation form, you will also see a record of it in the admin email account. Once you receive such a record, you can then add them to the Slack channel. To do so, go into slack and hit the following button on the bottom left-hand side: -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](images/manual_img/project_admi_10.png){width=30%} -->
<!-- </center> -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- Fill out their name and email in the dialog box and hit enter. Then go back to the Application sheet and enter the **date in month-day **form into the final two columns showing that they 1) have been added to slack and 2) have passed the test/committed. -->
<!-- Once the RA has been added to Slack you need to add them to the channel of the country or region they have been assigned to. Introduce them in the channel with a brief message and check back to see that the CM/RM has greeted them. It is also important that you add them to the **`#`onboarding channel**, where new RAs can ask questions during their first weeks on the project. Through that channel they will also be invited to an initial coding hour where they will be onboarded on data integration. For this, it is important that there is communication between Project Management and CM/RMs to assign new RAs policy categories to work on during this coding hour.  -->
<!-- <center> -->
<!-- ![](images/manual_img/project_admi_11.png){width=30%} -->
<!-- </center> -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- * Also Add them to the **Shiny App** by inviting them via email. Will require access to the Shiny App. -->
<!-- <span style="color:white; background-color: green;">**STEP 4: **</span>Finally, when people are good to go, they need to be allocated to a Hogwarts House. Please check the [allocation sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qxkKu7gOdt2I0JjgJmviD6EpKdJoP9gU1p5cjOqgONk/edit?usp=sharing) if there are people that have not been assigned to houses. While some people will write down their preference in the allocation form, some will just let the sorting hat decide. Please try to distribute the people equally along the houses. After you allocate a RA to a house via the allocation sheet (Column F), add them to your Slack House Channel (this can only be done by the respective prefects). When you have done so, send the applicant a welcome email to your house (be sure to offer to answer any questions they may have!), and add them to your Slack channel. Be sure to finally go back to the application Google sheet and enter the date they were added to your house. -->
