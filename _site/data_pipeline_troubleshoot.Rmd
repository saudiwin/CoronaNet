# Intro

This document provides documentation for changes to the pipeline made to solve previously found bugs in the pipeline. Its purpose is to help ensure that any future changes to the pipeline to solve newly found bugs do not recreate older bugs (and to limit the extent such changes might create new ones).

Each previously solved problem gets its own section with a brief description of the problem provided in the heading. Subheadings then capture:

1. Further **details** about a given problem
2. An **example** which illustrates the problem for a given record_id/policy_id
3. Documentation of **all known record_id/policy_ids this problem affected**
4. The **code snippet** which resolved the problem
5. A **check** to see if the current version of the dataset matches a screenshot of an older version that has correctly processed the given example as well as the record_id/policy_id which exemplifies the new bug we want to fix

In this version of the markdown, we are testing to make sure that any changes to solve problems reported with the following policy_ids: `r test_policy_ids`   maintain consistency with previously solved issues.  



# Multiple corrections to the same update need to be properly processed 

## Details

Previously when there were multiple corrections to the same update, only one of the corrections would overwrite the update, leaving the other correction still hanging out there in the dataset as an unresolved duplicate.

## Example

The 4th and 5th entries in the attached screenshot are both corrections to the update (3rd entry). But only one of them overwrites the update entry while the other one transforms into a new extraneous update during processing .

## Record or policy ids this affected

This problem is known to have affected the following ids: 

```{r }

policy_id<- c(3313228)
```

## Code which resolves this issue

This code can be found in 2b: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
kept_corrected_updates <- qualtrics %>%
  group_by(correct_record_id) %>%
  arrange(desc(recorded_date), .group_by = TRUE) %>%
  filter(entry_type %in% 'update') %>%
  filter(any(
    correct_dum %in% 'correction' &
      entry_type %in% 'update' & !is.na(update_id_qurl)
  )) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(record_id_overwrite) %>% # This part of the code fixes this problem deletes multiple corrections to the same update
  arrange(desc(recorded_date)) %>% # This part of the code fixes this problem deletes multiple corrections to the same update
  slice(1) %>%                    # This part of the code fixes this problem deletes multiple corrections to the same update
  ungroup()%>%
  group_by(correct_record_id) %>%
  filter(ResponseId %!in% update_id_qurl) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(correct_record_id, update_id_qurl) %>%
  mutate(index = 1:n()) %>%
  filter(case_when(
    all(correct_dum == 'original') ~ TRUE,
    all(correct_dum == 'correction') &
      min(index) ~ TRUE
  )) %>%
  ungroup() 

```


## Check if code still works

* The output of the code below for 3313228 should match the should match the screenshot (taken on June 5, 2021)  below insofar as:

  + new entry: 'On February 26, 2021, the Governor of Aichi Prefecture (Japan) ŌMURA Hideaki announced that, “to prevent further spread of COVID-19, the Aichi Prefectural Government has declared a critical stage.” Therefore, the Aichi Prefectural Government requested residents to “avoid going outside” after 9pm. The requested period is 14 days, starting from March 1, 2021 through March 14, 2021."
  + update 1: 'On March 10, 2021, the Governor of Aichi Prefecture (Japan) ŌMURA Hideaki announced that the requested period for this measure has been extended until March 21, 2021.'


Note: that the record ids may change if there are future corrections and that ii. there may be additional updates to this policy to come

![](imgs/3313228_correct.png)



```{r echo = FALSE}

ra_data_pull_purified_all_sample %>%
  filter(policy_id %in% c( 3313228,
                           test_policy_ids
                           
                           )) %>%
  arrange(policy_id) %>% 
 select(record_id, policy_id,correct_record_id,  correct_dum, recorded_date, entry_type,  link_type, description_update, type,  date_end_spec, date_end)%>%
   kbl(caption = "Check whether multiple corrections to the same update are removed/processed") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F, font_size = 11) %>%
  column_spec(8, width_min = '3in') 
   ```

 


# Keep multiple updates to a new entry (while also making sure to remove multiple corrections to the same update as noted above)

## Details

When there are multiple updates to the same new_entry, it is important to not delete them while at the same time removing multiple corrections to a given update. 


##  Example 

In the example below, the following code correctly keeps all updates to a given new_entry(223262) but fails to delete multiple corrections to a given update (3313228)

```{r eval = FALSE}
kept_corrected_updates_1 <- qualtrics %>%
  group_by(correct_record_id) %>%
  arrange(desc(recorded_date), .group_by = TRUE) %>%
  filter(entry_type %in% 'update') %>%
  filter(any(correct_dum %in% 'correction' & entry_type %in% 'update' & !is.na(update_id_qurl))) %>%
  filter(record_id %!in% update_id_qurl) %>%
  group_by(correct_record_id, update_id_qurl) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup()

```
![](imgs/correct_223262_incorrect_3313228.png)


Conversely the following code incorrectly deletes some updates to a given new_entry (223262) but correctly deletes multiple corrections to a given update (3313228)

```{r eval = FALSE}

kept_corrected_updates <- qualtrics %>%
  group_by(correct_record_id) %>%
  arrange(desc(recorded_date), .group_by = TRUE) %>%
  filter(entry_type %in% 'update') %>%
  filter(any(correct_dum %in% 'correction' & entry_type %in% 'update' & !is.na(update_id_qurl))) %>%
  filter(record_id %!in% update_id_qurl) %>%
  ungroup() 
 
```

## Record or policy ids this affected

This problem is known to have affected the following ids: 

```{r  echo=FALSE}

policy_id <- c(2223262)
```


## Solution

The following code both keeps multiple updates to the same new_entry while also deleting multipe corrections to the same update


``` {r eval = FALSE}

kept_corrected_updates <- qualtrics %>%
  group_by(correct_record_id) %>%
  arrange(desc(recorded_date), .group_by = TRUE) %>%
  filter(entry_type %in% 'update') %>%
  filter(any(
    correct_dum %in% 'correction' &
      entry_type %in% 'update' & !is.na(update_id_qurl)
  )) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(record_id_overwrite) %>% # This part of the code fixes this problem deletes multiple corrections to the same update
  arrange(desc(recorded_date)) %>% # This part of the code fixes this problem deletes multiple corrections to the same update
  slice(1) %>%                     # This part of the code fixes this problem deletes multiple corrections to the same update
  ungroup()%>%
  group_by(correct_record_id) %>%
  filter(ResponseId %!in% update_id_qurl) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(correct_record_id, update_id_qurl) %>% # This part of the code makes sure we keep multiple updates to the same new entry
  mutate(index = 1:n()) %>%  # This part of the code makes sure we keep multiple updates to the same new entry
  filter(case_when( # This part of the code makes sure we keep multiple updates to the same new entry
    all(correct_dum == 'original') ~ TRUE, # This part of the code makes sure we keep multiple updates to the same new entry
    all(correct_dum == 'correction') & # This part of the code makes sure we keep multiple updates to the same new entry
      min(index) ~ TRUE # This part of the code makes sure we keep multiple updates to the same new entry
  )) %>%
  ungroup() 


```

## Check if code still works

* The output of the code below for 2223262 should match the screenshot (taken on June 5, 2021) below insofar as the policy history in the description should include the following ( i. note that the record ids may change if there are future corrections and that ii. there may be additional updates to this policy to come)
  + new entry: "Canada, Manitoba, March 23, 2020. Public health officials “are recommending that anyone who returns from [domestic] travel … should self-isolate … for 14 days following their return. This recommendation does not include: the commercial transportation of goods and services; workers, including health-care workers who live in a neighbouring jurisdiction and travel to Manitoba for work; or normal personal travel in border communities including visits to a cottage"
  + update 1: "Canada, Manitoba, April 17, 2020. “The chief provincial public health officer has updated public health orders that take effect on April 17, and will be in effect until May 1, 2020.

## Details

Corrections RAs make to a new_entry should percolate down to teh whole policy thread; previously it didn't


##  Example 

In the example below, the new entry was originally coded as  'External Border Restrictions' but was then corrected to be a 'Quarantine'. However, the update for this new_entry remained 'External Border Restrictions'

## Record or policy ids this affected

This problem is known to have affected the following ids: 

```{r  echo=FALSE}

policy_id <- c(1620615)
```



## Solution

```{r eval = FALSE}

  fill(all_of(miss_vars[-which(grepl('update', miss_vars))]), .direction = "down") %>%
  ungroup()


```



## Check code still works

* The output of the code below should match the screenshot for policy_id 1620615 insofar as the 'type' of policy for new_entry and all subsequent updates should be 'Quarantine'


![](imgs/1620615_correct.png)

```{r}

ra_data_pull_purified_all_sample %>%
  filter(policy_id %in% c( 1620615,
                           test_policy_ids
                           
                           )) %>%
  arrange(policy_id) %>% 
    select(record_id, policy_id,correct_record_id,  correct_dum, recorded_date, entry_type,  link_type, type,  date_end_spec, date_end)  %>%
     kbl(caption = "Check whether corrections to new entries flow through to updates") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F, font_size = 11) %>%
  column_spec(8, width_min = '3in') 
```


NOTE:  there is more than one type of policy for a given tested record, there is a problem with the code

```{r}
ra_data_pull_purified_all_sample %>%
  filter(policy_id %in% c( 1620615,
                           test_policy_ids
                           )) %>%
  group_by(policy_id) %>%
  summarise(unique_types = length(unique(type)))%>%
  ungroup

```
