This is the permanent home for data and resources related to CoronaNet,
a project to create a policy dataset for government actions in response
to COVID-19. Data collection for this project has finished and current
efforts are aimed at cleaning and systematizing the data. Currently
there is coverage for most countries in the world and for hundreds of
sub-national units, including provinces and cities, from January of 2020
through December of 2021. The most complete coverage is for the European
Union and Russia thanks for a EU Horizons Initiative grant. Coverage of
other countries has been increased through data integration from other
COVID-19 policy projects, including the Oxford COVID-19 Government
Response Tracker and COVID-AMP.

At present, the project is being led by [PIs Cindy Cheng and Robert
Kubinec](about.html).
